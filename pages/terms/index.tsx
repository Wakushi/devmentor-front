					At DEVMentor, we collect certain personal information to

					distribute rewards. This includes collecting mentors'
					contact information, which is provided voluntarily by the
					mentors for the purpose of being contacted by their mentees.
					Mentors have the ability to update this contact information
					at any time. However, users should be aware that while
					contact information can be updated, any data interaction
					with the blockchain, including initial submissions, is
					permanent and immutable due to the nature of blockchain
					technology. This means that once information is recorded on
					the blockchain, it cannot be altered or removed.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to contact information, mentors are required to
					provide an email address to receive certain rewards. Please
					be assured that these email addresses are not stored on the
					blockchain, nor are they saved in any database. They are
					used solely for the purpose of reward distribution and are
					not shared with any third parties without explicit consent.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users and
					ensuring transparency in how their data is used. We
					encourage all users to carefully consider the information
					they share and remind them of the public and permanent
					nature of blockchain-based transactions.
				</p>
